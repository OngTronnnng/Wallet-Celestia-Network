We will assume that we want to create a simple wallet application for the Celestia network. More specifically, our application will allow users to create new wallets, store tokens on the wallet, and perform token transactions.

To do this, we need to use some libraries and APIs of the Celestia network. In this example, we will use the requests library to connect to the Celestia network API and store the wallet information in a simple text file.

**First, we'll write a function to create a new wallet:**

import uuid

def create_wallet():
    """
    Creates a new wallet and returns the wallet address.
    :return: The new wallet address as a string.
    """
    wallet_address = str(uuid.uuid4())
    with open("wallets.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"{wallet_address}\n")
    return wallet_address

**Next, we will write a function to get the balance of a token on a wallet:**

API_URL = "https://api.celestia.org"

def get_token_balance(wallet_address, token_symbol):
    """
    Retrieves the balance of a token on a wallet.
    :param wallet_address: The address of the wallet.
    :param token_symbol: The symbol of the token.
    :return: The balance of the token as a float.
    """
    endpoint = f"{API_URL}/wallet/{wallet_address}/balance?token_symbol={token_symbol}"
    response = requests.get(endpoint)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return float(response.text)
    else:
        return None

**Finally, we will write a simple program that uses the above functions and allows users to create new wallets, store tokens on the wallet, and perform token transactions:**

def main():
    wallet_address = input("Enter your wallet address: ")
    print(f"Your wallet address is: {wallet_address}")

    choice = None
    while choice != "4":
        print("\nWhat would you like to do?")
        print("1. Create a new wallet")
        print("2. View token balances")
        print("3. Transfer tokens")
        print("4. Quit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

        if choice == "1":
            wallet_address = create_wallet()
            print(f"Your new wallet address is: {wallet_address)")
        elif choice == "2":
            token_symbol = input("Enter the token symbol to view balance: ")
            balance = get_token_balance(wallet_address, token_symbol)
            if balance:
                print(f"Your {token_symbol} balance is: {balance}")
            else:
                print("Unable to retrieve balance.")
        elif choice == "3
